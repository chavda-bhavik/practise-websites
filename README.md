# CSS Practise Websites
This is a list of websites that I use to practise CSS. I have tried to categorise them as best as I can. I have also tried to include a description of the website and what I have learnt from it. I have also included a link to the website and a link to the GitHub repo if it is available.

I've used [html-sass-jumstart](https://github.com/5t3ph/html-sass-jumpstart/issues) to create projects and website ideas are taken from [learning-zone/website-templates](https://github.com/learning-zone/website-templates).
